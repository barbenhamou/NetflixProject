# Running The App

Before you run the app, you also need to run the backend servers. See [HowToRun](../WebApp/HowToRun.md) for explanation on how to do that.
Another thing you need before you start is to upload images and videos to the emulator, in order to add a profile picture and movies to the app.

Navigate to View -> Tool Windows -> Device Explorer
