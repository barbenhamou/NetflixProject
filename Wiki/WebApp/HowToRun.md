Download the code and run the `RunServers.sh` file. For Linux/MacOS:
```bash
./RunServers.sh
```
For Windows:
```bash
bash RunServers.sh
```

It will then ask for your IP address. After you enter it, it will print the URL of the website and compile the code. It may take a few minutes, but when it's done you can go to the URL.

The terminal should look like this when the compilation finishes:
