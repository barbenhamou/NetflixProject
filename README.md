# Work Process
To make the work fair and efficient we divided our work equally and uploaded it to the JIRA. At first, we sat down for a couple of days planning each task. Then we've done some brainstorming about how can I make a particular feature or task modular as much as possible so future additions won't cause much of a change, or even no change and only additions ("Close to changes and open to additions"). Then we got to work.

In order to make our work possible, we used GitHub version control system. Each one had his own tasks and subtasks, for each task (or user story) we've created a feature branch with its associated JIRA's issue key (NP-ISSUEKEY-FEATURE). Each commit we've added the issue key of the feature that the commit is associated with. 
When integrating our feature, we created a "pull request" to the main branch, and the other two members were required to approve it. After approval, the git-master (Bar) merged the incoming branch to the main.

To keep track of our work, we changed the status of our tasks in JIRA (To Do -> In Progress -> Code Review -> Done). We had at least two status meetings a week, discussing about our progress/problems/change of plans, all documented by the jira-master(Arbel).
