# Nexflit Project
This is a project for the course "Advanced System programming" of Bar-Ilan University.

This project is a movie streaming platform similar to Netflix, through a Web-App and an Android App.
Check out the [Wiki](Wiki) to learn how to run it, and everything it can do!

# Work Process
To make the work fair and efficient we divided our tasks as equally as possible and created tasks in the JIRA website. At first, we sat down and planned each task. Then we've done some brainstorming about how can we make a particular feature or task modular as much as possible so future additions won't cause much of a change, or even no change and only additions ("Close to changes and open to extentions"). Then we got to work.

In order to make our work possible, we used GitHub version control system. Each one had his own tasks and subtasks, for each task (or user story) we've created a feature branch with its associated JIRA issue key. In each commit we've added the issue key of the task that the commit is associated with.
When integrating our features, we created pull requests to the main branch, and the other two members were required to go over it and approve it. After approval, the Git-master (Bar) merged the incoming branch to the main.

To keep track of our work, we changed the status of our tasks in JIRA (To Do -> In Progress -> Code Review -> Done). We had at least two status meetings a week, discussing about our progress/problems/change of plans/plans for future work, all documented by the SCRUM-master (Arbel) in the JIRA.
